# PHSX815_Week11

One of the first things I did while 'playing around' with the code was check how the accurary varies with the number of epochs. I have attached the behavior as a plot in the repository. I had expected the behavior to be somewhat linear when the number of epochs was less than 100, but that did not seem to be the case. After 1000, the accuracy almost flattens at around 0.5.
